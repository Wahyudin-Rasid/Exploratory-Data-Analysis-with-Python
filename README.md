# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python
some sales data from order.csv dataset.

Here are the details:

1.) The median price paid by the customer for each payment method.

2.) Determine the payment method that has the largest basket size (mean median price).
Change freight_value to shipping_cost and find the most expensive shipping_cost from the sales data using sort.

3.) For each product_category_name, what is the average weight of the product and which standard deviation is the smallest from that weight,

4.) Create a histogram of sales quantity from the dataset to see the distribution of the sales quantity with bins = 5 and figsize = (4,5)

Especially for point 4, please pay more attention to the script, because the results of the analysis will be used by the branch head in formulating a free shipping strategy.
